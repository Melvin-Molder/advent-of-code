# Advent of Code

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This repository contains my solutions to the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles released daily in December, leading up to Christmas. It's a fun and challenging way to sharpen programming skills and explore creative problem-solving techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ YYYY/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day01/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day02/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ day25/
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- **`YYYY/`**: Each folder corresponds to a specific year of Advent of Code (e.g., `2024/`).
- **`dayXX/`**: Each day has its own folder containing the solution and input data.
  - `solution.py`: The Python script containing the solution.
  - `input.txt`: The puzzle input for that day.
  - `README.md`: Optional explanation or notes about the day's puzzle.

## Prerequisites

To run the solutions, you'll need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>= 3.8)
- Recommended: A virtual environment to manage dependencies.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code.git
   cd advent-of-code
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired day folder:
   ```bash
   cd 2024/day01
   ```

3. Run the solution:
   ```bash
   python solution.py
   ```

## Approach

Each day's puzzle is approached with the following goals in mind:

1. **Readability**: Writing clear and understandable code.
2. **Efficiency**: Striving for optimal performance when processing large inputs.
3. **Learning**: Experimenting with new libraries, algorithms, or paradigms.
